# ytdlp-downloader

## Tiny docker project to download medias from youtube by yt-dlp, with a tiny php webpage.

Originally, I imagine that little tool to download my songs and shows from youtube (with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), which is amazing) on my home-server, but without using CLI. I love docker, but I didn't find any sort of projects to do the exact same thing, so i decided to create this one.

I assume, only for the webpage, I used ChatGPT 3.5 (because HTML/CSS/PHP aren't in my skills, particullary PHP which I didn't touch before). Dockerfile was made with hands and love (only to take good time working on a little project, enough to be satisfied).

## How to install ytdlp-downloader

/!\ I don't mention, but requirements are : `docker`.

First of all, you're gonna need to copy the github content with :

    git clone https://github.com/AliceT50/ytdlp-downloader.git

Theoretically...
